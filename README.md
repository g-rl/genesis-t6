## Idea

> A mini battle royale mode where the player is able to upgrade their weapons & equipment etc through loot crates around the map.
> Maps will include different traps

## Roadmap

🎇 **Sound & FX**  
> Add sounds & fx for all events such as killed by mines, etc

📦 **Map Support**  
> Add crate locations for most / all important maps

🔄 **Persistant Ammo**  
> Make sure ammo stays throughout lives.

🎲 **Dynamic Item Spawns**  
> Have different items such as equipment placed in random areas players are able to pickup.
